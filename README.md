README for Rainfall Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting extreme rainfall events using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains weather-related variables such as temperature, humidity, and sunshine, which are used to model rainfall patterns. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model fitting, emphasizing quantile regression and seasonalized quantile regression.

File Structure
The repository contains six key code files and one CSV file:

1. data_cleaning.py
Cleans the dataset by handling incorrect data formats, inconsistent entries, and irrelevant columns.
Outputs a clean and structured dataset ready for analysis.
2. missing_value_imputation.py
Deals with missing values using techniques like mean, median, or interpolation methods.
Ensures the dataset is complete and consistent without introducing bias.
3. handling_outliers.py
Identifies and manages outliers using statistical methods such as IQR or Z-scores.
Ensures robust data for better model performance.
4. correlation_analysis.py
Calculates correlation between variables to understand relationships.
Visualizes correlation matrices to identify key predictors of rainfall.
5. quantile_regression_model.py
Implements quantile regression to predict rainfall quantiles, focusing on extreme values.
Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics like MAE or Pinball loss.
6. seasonal_quantile_regression.py
Extends quantile regression by incorporating seasonality effects (e.g., months or quarters).
Captures seasonal patterns in rainfall for improved accuracy in predictions.
7. rainfall_data.csv
Contains the weather dataset used for training and evaluation.
Includes variables like Min_Temp, Max_Temp, Rainfall, Cloud, Sunshine, Humidity, and Month.
